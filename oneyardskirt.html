           For this project you need one yard of any non-stretch fabric. 
           There is no pattern involved in this project but we will be using simple measurement to fit the skirt to your body.<br>

            <ul>
                Supplies
                <li>1-yard of non-stretch fabric</li>
                <li> Package of 1 inch wide elastic</li>
                <li>Matching thread</li>
                <li>Straight pins</li>
                <li>Large safety pin</li>
                <li>Tailors chalk</li>
                <li>Iron</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="summary">
            <ol>
                <li>Take the one yard of fabric and fold it in half along its width with salvages together so that the right side (pattern side) of the fabric is touching.
                You will be working on the wrong side (non-patterned) of the material.</li>
                <li>A yard of fabric is 36 inches in length always, the width will vary by the type of material you chose. The most common widths are 45, 54, and 60 inches. 
                If you are using 60" wide material when you fold it in half it should measure 30"w x 36"L.
                Cut the fabric in half along the fold. This is now the unfinished heam of your skirt.</li>
                <li>Pin on the shorter sides of the fabric to form side seams.</li>
                <li>Using a 5/8" seam allowance, sew the fabric all the way down on one side only.</li>
                <li>On the other side of the skirt,measure 2" down from the top of the skirt and mark.</li>
                <li> Starting from this mark, sew this side closed.</li>
                <li>Iron the seams open on both sides.</li>
                <li>Now you will have a tube. On the side where you left the 2" unfinished, make a 1/4" fold and iron all the way around.</li>
                <li>Fold again this time stopping where you made the mark and iron all the way around.</li>
                <li> Sew the fold down, this will create an opening in the casing for the elastic.</li>
                <li>Take the elastic and wrap it around your waist where you want the skirt to start. Pull it taut and overlap it, 
                the elastic should not be loose but not so tight as to dig into your flesh. Cut your elastic at this point.</li>
                <li>Insert the large safety pin into one end of the elastic, you will use this to snake it through the waist band casing.</li>
                <li>Once the elastic is all the way through, pin the two ends together. Take this time to look at your skirt and try it on. 
                If you feel there is too much fabric take the elastic out, cut the skirt down on the side with the casing hole and repeat steps 5-12.</li>
                <li>If the skirt feels right, overlap the ends and sew the elastic together using a zig-zag stitch. Go over it several times on the overlapped square 
                to make sure it doesn't come undone.</li>
                <li>Put the skirt on still with the wrong side facing out, and decide on how long you want it to be. Mark, fold along the entire skirt, pin in place, 
                iron and heam using 5/8" seam allowance.</li>
                <li>Turn skirt to the right side and you are done.</li>
