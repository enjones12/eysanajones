         This is currently the most difficult project on this site but it is not a very complex pattern in general.
         <ul>
             Supplies
             <li>T-shirt or tanktop</li>
             <li>2 yards of non-stretch fabric</li>
             <li>Matching thread</li>
             <li>Package of 2" wide elastic</li>
             <li>straight pins</li>
         </ul>
         
         </div>
         
         <div class="summary">
             <ol>
                <li>Put on your T-shirt or tanktop and mark a line under your bust.This is a high/empire waist dress.</li> 
                <li>Remove your shirt and cut away the material below this mark. Retain for later.</li>
                <li>Take the elastic and mesure under your bust in the same place where you cut the shirt earlier. Stretch it slightly and overlap the ends, it should be snug not tight, cut.</li>
                <li>Cut your 2 yards of fabric into separate 1 yard panels, use the stretched elastic as a guide for how wide the waist should be. 
                Try to make an even number of<a href="https://www.craftsy.com/blog/2013/10/how-to-sew-pleats/"> pleats</a> on both pieces.</li>
                <li>Sew your panels together on both sides to make the skirt.</li>
                <li>From the extra t-shirt material we saved from earlier, cut two 3"wide strips.
                Place the top of the skirt in-between the two strips have the wrong sides of the strips facing out and pin</li><!--pic of how the strips should be cut-->
                <li>Sew all the way around and flip the strips up to the right sides.</li>
                <li> You need to place pins symmetrically on the front, back, and sides of the skirt,you will need these to align the skirt with the top .
                Place pins on the front, back and sides of the shirt. The skirt will be bigger than the top.</li>
                <li>Attach the t-shirt to the skirt using the pins we placed in the step before as guides. Flip both the top and the skirt to the wrong side. 
                You will only pin the outer strip of the skirt to the top and sew them together using 5/8" seam allowance.</li>
                <li>When you turn the dress the outside will look done but you will have a hanging strip on the inside.</li>
                <li>On the inside of the dress, attach the elastic to the hanging strip and the seam allowance that was left inside from the other strip.
                The elastic will be shorter than the waist of the skirt, stretch the elastic as you pin it around.</li>
                <li>When you sew elastic hold the fabric and elastic firmly with your right hand as you feed it into the machine, with your left hand pull the sewn fabric slightly as it comes out of the machine.</li>
                <li>Continue all the way around</li>
                <li>The dress is finished, now you can add a wide belt to cover the waist or you can make a simple sash with the same or matching fabric.</li>
