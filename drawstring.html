                 <ol>
                     <h1>Drawstring bag</h1>
                    <li>Cut out 1 piece of fabric measuring 19"L x 12"W.</li> 
                    <li>Set your sewing machine to a zig-zag stitch, zig-zag all your edges.</li>
                    <li>Fold the fabric, with right sides together, in half on the length so it is now 9.5"L x 12"W.</li>
                    <li>Pin on both sides.</li>
                    <li>Starting at the top of the bag, measure 2" down and mark a line across both sides. Measure another 2" down from the first line and mark.</li>
                    <li>Sew the side of the bag using a 5/8" seam allowance starting at the bottom of the bag stopping at the first line mark you meet.</li>
                    <li>Back stitch, then stop sewing, lift the presser foot and pull the fabric so the needle is lined up over the second line. Sew to the end,
                    there will be a section of unstiched fabric, this is needed to insert the drawstring.</li>
                    <li>Repeat steps 6 and 7 on the other side</li>
                    <li>Now fold down the top of the bag 4 1/4" so that it is slightly below the second mark on the bag and pin in place. </li>
                    <li>Sew all the way around.</li>
                    <li>Cut the ribbon in half and insert one piece going in and out of one hole and the other piece going in and out of the other hole. Turn to the right side and it is ready to use. </li>
                     
                 </ol>
                 
                 <ol>
                     <h1>Zippered Pouch</h1>
                    <li>Cut out 2 pieces of fabric measuring 11"L x 7"W.</li> 
                    <li>Set your sewing machine to a zig-zag stitch, zig-zag all your edges. This will keep them from fraying.</li>
                    <li>Place the zipper centered on the edge of the fabric and mark where it begins and ends.</li>
                    <li>Pin with right sides together, start sewing the fabric together using a 5/8" seam allowance stop at the first mark and back stitch.</li>
                    <li>Change the machine to a basting stitch and sew to the second mark.</li>
                    <li>Change the machine back to the regular straight stitch, sew half an inch, back stitch, then continue to sew to the end of that side.</li>
                    <li>Press the seam flat.</li>
                    <li>Place the zipper on top of the seam with the zipper facing down and line it up with the marks from earlier. Pin in place on both sides.</li>
                    <li>Put the Zipper foot on the sewing machine. A zipper foot is not centered when you put it on the machine, it has two bars and you shift it to the left or the right depending on 
                    which side of the zipper you are sewing down. If you are sewing on the left side of the zipper the foot should be on the left and vis versa.</li>
                    <li>Sew down one side of the zipper, around the bottom, switch the foot over and sew the other side of the zipper.</li>
                    <li>Turn the fabric to the right side and use the seam ripper to  remove the basting stitches. Check the zipper to make sure it moves smoothly and close it back most of the way,
                    there needs to be space to pull the pouch through.</li>
                    <li>Now that the zipper is inserted, turn the fabric back to the wrong side pin and sew all the remaining seams together using a 5/8" allowance.</li>
                    <li>Pull the pouch through to the right side using the space we left in the zipper and the pouch is ready to use.</li>
