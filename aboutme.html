         Hi, I'm Ian Jay and this is my site. I am an artist who has also taken up simple DIY home projects.
         My mother was an avid seamstress in my youth and I always found clothes making interesting. 
         As I said on my home page the dresses she made me really sparked a longing to create some of my own.
         I am not a professional by any means, and most of my project are a bit of trial and error.
         I started this site during my search for quick project that did not require a store bought pattern.
         Those things are expensive! I came across projects through classes or on the internet that I have changed
         to work better for me. I'm also working on crochet projects as well, but I have a patience problem and crochet takes
         up quite a bit of time. I hope you enjoy my site and my projects bring you and your loved ones happiness and satisfaction.
