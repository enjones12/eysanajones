             <p>This is a jewelry making project and it is very simple. These beads are usually worn under the clothes around the waist.</p>
             
            <ul>
                Supplies
             <li>1 Roll of .33mm bead string wire (any color)</li>
             <li>1 Wire cutter/ plier set for jewelry making</li>
             <li>Crimping pliers</li>
             <li>1 Package of lobster clasps</li>
             <li>Glass seed beads in size 6/0 "E" and 11/0 in complementary colors (I suggest a minimum of three colors with at least 1 color being size 6/0)</li>
             <li>1 Package of crimp tubes in size #2</li>
             <li>Measuring tape</li>
             <li>Bead stopper</li>
             </ul>
             
        </div>    

            <div class="summary">
                <ol>
                    <li>Measure your waist and add 3" to that number. Cut off 2 peices of wire this length.</li>
                    <li>Take the 2 pieces at one end and line them up so they are even, slide 1 crimp tube over both wires together leaving 1 1/2" above the tube.</li>
                    <li>Place 1 lobster clasp on to the wire above the crimp tube.</li>
                    <li>Using the chain nose pliers, bend the wire above the crimp tube over itself and down into the crimp tube again so that it forms a loop securing the clasp.</li>
                    <li>Use the crimping pliers according to manufactures instructions to close the tube.</li>
                    <li>Starting at the other end of the wires string the beads on one wire in any pattern combination that you like. 
                    Make sure to count the beads, for example if you string a section of 8- 6/0 size then 12- 11/0 size continue with those numbers so the pattern won't look odd. 
                    If you want you can add an accent charm or bead to the middle.</li>
                    <li>Leave 1 1/2" of space as you approach the end of this wire. Use the bead stopper to hold the design in place while you work on the other strand of wire.</li>
                    <li>When stringing the other wire change the pattern slightly. I usually reverse the colors.</li>
                    <li>Leave 1 1/2" of space as you approach the end of this wire. Remove the bead stoppers from the other strand of beads and hold both 1 1/2" empty spaces, place 1 crimp tube on both.</li>
                    <li>Repeat steps 3-5.</li>
                    <li>If you have extra wire tails after you crimp carefully cut them off while avoiding the wires holding the beads.</li>
                    <li>Now the waist beads are finished, try them on.</li>
                </ol>
